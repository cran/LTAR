Description: A set of tools for forecasting the next step in a multidimensional setting using tensors.  In the examples, a forecast is made of sea surface temperatures of a geographic grid (i.e. lat/long).  Each observation is a matrix, the entries in the matrix and the sea surface temperature at a particular lattitude/longitude. Cates, J., Hoover, R. C., Caudle, K., Kopp, R., & Ozdemir, C.
